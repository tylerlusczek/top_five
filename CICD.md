## CI/CD Experience
I have little prior CI/CD experience, as products I worked on was just internal and never fully deployed.

## Other Suggestions
- Change the UI to be more colorful
- Give spacing around the items
- Fill up the space on the page by making everything centered
- Change the font and sizes to be less bland
- Add a way to see everyone elses submissions
- Make different pages so everything isn't cramed on one index.html
